Hello guys, 
Using vim is a pain in the ass, why would one use a keyboard only text editor.
I do not understand this thing, yet here I am.
I will try my best to explore everything related to web dev, both front end and backend.
Hope I will do good.

I have associated notepad++ with git bash, yet i am unable to figure out how to use it.
For the time being I will have to do with VIM, the keyboard text editor.
Hope its creator is well, so I can kill him/her personally.
On the other hand, notepad might be most basic bitch in the whole damn world, but still it has its pros too.
I now realise that I might have strayed off topic, I must get back to learning git.
Regards,
Shikhar Agrawal
